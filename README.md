Scrollable widgets, which lets you easily animate its items list modifications(insert, remove, move, etc.).

At the moment, this package provides `ListView`, `GridView`, and `PageView` implementations.

`AnimatedListView` / `SliverAnimatedListView` | `AnimatedGridView` / `SliverAnimatedGridView`

## **Disclaimer**
_Be careful using this package in production because there are still many untested cases._

## **[LIVE DEMO](live_demo_link)**
## **[MEDIUM ARTICLE](medium_article_link)**
## **[API REFERENCE](api_reference_link)**


_Examples(from live demo) can be found [here][live_demo_examples_link].
Real application examples can be found [here][real_app_example_link1] and [here][real_app_example_link2]_

Mainly, developed as a replacement for out-of-the-box animated scrollables:

- `AnimatedList`
- `SliverAnimatedList`
- `AnimatedGrid` (available from flutter version 3.7.0)
- `SliverAnimatedGrid` (available from flutter version 3.7.0)

because of their numerous disadvantages:

- Scroll offset jumps when an item is built atop(outside) of the current
layout(Issue [#74031](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/74031)):
  
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radomir9720/animated_scroll_view/main/doc/images/animated_list_offset_jump_demo.gif"/>
- Out-of-the-box animated scrollables have inconvinient API, developer
is required to write a lot of code to make it work
- There is a lot of cases when developer can forget/miss something to setup,
and, as a result, lose a lot of time figuring out what's wrong(e.g. [#63185](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/63185))
- `AnimatedGrid` and `SliverAnimatedGrid` are not available if you are using
flutter version below 3.7.0

Also, `AnimatedPageView` widget can be useful for you, as it does not have an out of the box analogue:

There are already implementations-replacements for each of the
out-of-the-box animated scrollables mentioned above:

- `AnimatedListView` (replacement for `AnimatedList`)
- `SliverAnimatedListView` (replacement for `SliverAnimatedList`)
- `AnimatedGridView` (replacement for `AnimatedGrid`)
- `SliverAnimatedGridView` (replacement for `SliverAnimatedGrid`)

Also, you can extend `AnimatedScrollView`, and create your own
implementation, using the API of this package.
